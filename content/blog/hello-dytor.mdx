Welcome to the DYTOR blog. In this post, we explore how DYTOR achieves millisecond-accurate timing, role-based remote dashboards, and multi-display orchestration for professional productions.

## Precision Timing

DYTOR uses a hybrid timing architecture to deliver drift-free coordination across devices. This ensures your countdowns, count-ups, and schedule automation are always correct â€” especially when it matters.

## Role-Based Dashboards

From Admin to Queue Manager to Speaker and Viewer, each role sees exactly what they need. This improves speed, clarity, and safety in live environments.

## Multi-Display Control

Choose solid colors, imagery, or video backgrounds with adjustable opacity for your secondary display.
